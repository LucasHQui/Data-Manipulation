# Data-Manipulation

In this project, it was intended to explore the data from Instacart 🛒, a grocery delivery platform. The dataset 📊, released in 2017 for a Kaggle competition, was modified to facilitate your calculations. The mission 🎯 is to clean the data and prepare a report on the shopping habits of customers. Remember to explain your results and create clear charts 📈 to present them 🍀.
